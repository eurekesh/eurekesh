### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What I Do
My name is Ash and I *love* learning new things! I currently am studying abroad, but I typically assist teaching introductory C++ at CU Boulder. I have worked at [Cognex Corporation](https://www.cognex.com/) where I developed on embedded web interfaces for industrial barcode readers. This past summer I worked at [Amazon Advertising](https://advertising.amazon.com/)'s Audience Distribution team to make old things new again ðŸ˜„
