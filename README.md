### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What I Do
My name is Ash and I *love* learning new things! I typically assist teaching introductory C++ at CU Boulder. I have worked at [Cognex Corporation](https://www.cognex.com/) where I developed on embedded web interfaces for industrial barcode readers. The past two summers (2022-2023) I worked at [Amazon Advertising](https://advertising.amazon.com/)'s Audience Distribution team, where I owned the creation of internal auditing tools and created new customer-serving APIs for advertising campaign management.
